# Information Theoretic Mapping ROS 2 Library

This library containes ROS 2 nodes and utilities for
information-theoretic mapping. This is used as a submodule for an I-MPPI
controller.

All the nodes (algorithms) should be GPU accelerated. Since they are used in pairing with an I-MPPI controller that should be GPU accelerated as well.
